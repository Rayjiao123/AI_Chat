It put fellow tech titans to shame when its third-party web hosting unit set the standard for a new cloud computing model. Now it's taking on the nearly $4 trillion health care market, which could keep Amazon stock growing for years — if it succeeds. It is a long term buy in our opinion"

Tesla is not only executing well, but it's also arguably consistently exceeding expectations. The company is expanding with new factories globally, its vehicle sales are soaring, its battery storage business is growing quickly, and its vehicle software and driver-assistance technology are constantly improving. Yet investors should also realize that Tesla's stock price has reached levels that are becoming increasingly difficult to justify."]

If consumers become more confident in the vaccine,  theater attendance would grow, lifting all theater-chain stocks."
